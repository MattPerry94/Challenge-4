# Challenge-4

Unfortunately, I am getting some errors when it comes to the last little bit of my code (a Tutor session is set up). 

I was able to draw some conclusions from the 'sample pictures' that were provided to us.

1) There is a tremendous disparity between the overall pass rate when it relates to Charter and District schools.

2) Math seems to be the biggest issue for District schools as the pass rate is just over 66.5%.

3) Schools that are over 2000 students, have a tremendous drop-off in overall pass rates. Every category also falls, as it relates when comparing larger population schools to smaller schools.

4) The highest performing schools by '% Overall Passing' are all charter schools and District schools are all in the bottom five for '% Overall Passing'.
