# Challenge-4

Unfortunaetly, I am getting some errors when it comes to the last little bit of my code (Tutor session is set-up). 

I was able to draw some conclusions from the 'sample pictures' that we're provided that we're trying to match our code too.

3) Schools that are over 2000 students, has a tremendous drop-off in overall pass rates. Every category also falls, as it relates when comparing larger population schools to the smaller schools.

4) The higest performing schools by '% Overall Passing' are all charter schools and District schools are all in the bottom five for '% Overall Passing'.
